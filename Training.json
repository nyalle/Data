This evidence establishes that the\r\nsame entity commonly provides goods in the nature of those sold by applicant and registrant and that\r\nconsumers are therefore accustomed to seeing these types of goods sold by the same entities under the\r\nsame marks such that they are likely to be confused when encountering such goods sold under the same\r\nor similar marks.\r\nAccordingly, the goods are considered related for purposes of the likelihood of confusion analysis.

Leading Jewelers Guild, 82 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1905.\r\n\r\nBut the question of confusion is related not to the nature of the mark but to its effect \"when applied to the goods of the applicant.\" The only relevant application is made in the marketplace. The words \"when applied\" do not refer to a mental exercise, but to all of the known circumstances surrounding use of the mark (In re E.I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361 (CCPA 1973)).\r\n\r\nIt is proper to consider the E.I. DuPont Factors (In re E.I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361 (CCPA 1973)):\r\nThe similarity or dissimilarity of the marks in their entireties as to appearance, sound, connotation and commercial impression.\r\nApplicant\u2019s mark is NAC HOOH, wherein  \"NA\" is referred to the first two letters of the company's name \"Nachuan\" and \"C\" is referred to the first letter \"C\" of \"chuan\". \"HOOH\" is an onomatopoeia meaning to cheer, and it is more recognizable and easier to remember. Therefore, applicant believes the unique name can help consumers associate the trademark with the applicant, and distinguish it from others like the Registrant.\r\nRegistration stands for NORTH AMERICAN CABINETS. Consumers would know this by visiting the website of the Registrant (specimen enclosed). North American Cabinets is descriptive of the goods, and therefore the Registrant\u2019s mark NAC , which evokes the descriptive wording, is less distinctive than other marks might be. Further, consumers know the differences in the meaning and origin of the marks, and would appreciate the different connotations between NAC and NAC HOOH.\r\nEven where the marks at issue are identical, or nearly identical, the Board has found that differences in connotation can outweigh visual and phonetic similarity. See Blue Man Prods. Inc. v. Tarmann, 75 U.S.P.Q.2d 1811, 1820\u201321 (T.T.A.B.2005) (finding that BLUE MAN GROUP \u201Chas the connotation of the appearance of the performers\u201D and that applicant's BLUEMAN mark \u201Chas no such connotation for cigarettes or tobacco. Thus, the marks differ in their connotations and commercial impressions\u201D) (Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012). In the Coach case, even though the marks were identical the commercial impression was found to be very different, and no likelihood of confusion was found by the Court.\r\nThe similarity or dissimilarity of and nature of the goods or services as described in an application or registration or in connection with which a prior mark is in use.\r\nRegistration is for bathroom vanities and cabinets, along with installation services, while applicant is for \u201CBamboo furniture; Boxes of wood or plastic; Chests, not of metal; Drawer organizers; Hanging closet organizers; Jewellery organizer displays; Luggage racks being furniture; Plastic boxes; Plastic trays for foodstuff packaging; Rattan  \u201C in class 020. \r\n\r\nApplicant sells no bathroom vanities and cabinets, which also have different channels of trade from applicant\u2019s listed goods since they require installation, usually by a professional, which would need booking etc. Typically, you would buy the items like bathroom vanities and cabinets from the installer. Applicant\u2019s goods, on the other hand, might be sold in Wal-Mart, for example.\r\nThe fame of the prior mark (sales, advertising, length of use).\r\nThe Registration does not appear to be famous.\r\nThe nature and extent of any actual confusion.\r\nThere is no evidence of actual confusion.\r\nIt is submitted that the DuPont factors weigh in favor of the Applicant\u2019s mark, such that there is no likelihood of confusion with the cited Registration. \r\n"}

Further, the wording \"PLANNER\" is disclaimed in the mark in U.S. Registration\r\nNo. 5553623, PRISM PLANNER (with design), and the wording \"THE ARTIST'S SUPPLY STORE\"\r\nis disclaimed in the mark in U.S. Registration No. 2703909, PRIZM THE ARTIST'S SUPPLY STORE.\r\nSimilarly, as explained in the disclaimer requirement below, the wording \"CRAFT\" is merely\r\ndescriptive of applicant's mark.

Further,\r\napplicant's mark is in standard characters. A mark in typed or standard characters may be displayed in\r\nany lettering style; the rights reside in the wording or other literal element and not in any particular\r\ndisplay or rendition.

Leading Jewelers Guild, 82 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1905.\r\n\r\nBut the question of confusion is related not to the nature of the mark but to its effect \"when applied to the goods of the applicant.\" The only relevant application is made in the marketplace. The words \"when applied\" do not refer to a mental exercise, but to all of the known circumstances surrounding use of the mark (In re E.I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361 (CCPA 1973)).\r\n\r\nIt is proper to consider the E.I. DuPont Factors (In re E.I.

From the applicant, \u201Cthe products we are currently selling are 3d printed and I have other CNC machinery like lasers and routers that will be used to make future products.  CNC machines use different axis (X, Y, and Z) to reference their orientation and instruct them on how and where to move. Therefore, the Z in \"PRIZM\" could be seen as a reference to the Z axis on CNC machines like the 3d printers used to make our products.\u201D\r\nPRIZM has a unique non-standard spelling, and CRAFTS guides the connotation of the consumer towards craft items, rather than \u201Cplanners\u201D or \u201Cthe artist\u2019s supply store\u201D which carry a different connotation. \r\nEven where the marks at issue are identical, or nearly identical, the Board has found that differences in connotation can outweigh visual and phonetic similarity.

Leading Jewelers Guild, 82 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1905.\r\n\r\nBut the question of confusion is related not to the nature of the mark but to its effect \"when applied to the goods of the applicant.\" The only relevant application is made in the marketplace. The words \"when applied\" do not refer to a mental exercise, but to all of the known circumstances surrounding use of the mark (In re E.I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361 (CCPA 1973)).\r\n\r\nIt is proper to consider the E.I. DuPont Factors (In re E.I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361 (CCPA 1973)):\r\nThe similarity or dissimilarity of the marks in their entireties as to appearance, sound, connotation and commercial impression.\r\nThe Registrant\u2019s marks are TAKE OFF COLOR for makeup remover. The mark is descriptive since makeup remover is to remove (take off) colored makeup (color) from the skin. The Registrant has also disclaimed \u201Ccolor.\u201D Descriptive marks have a smaller ambit of protection since the words may be used by other competitors to describe their products. \r\nApplicant\u2019s mark DECOLLAGE in French means to unstick (de- meaning the negative, and collage means the noun for sticking. It translates to \u201Ctakeoff\u201D but strictly in an aviation or economic sense; to takeoff in an airplane, as in leave the ground (\u201Cun-stick\u201D), not \u201Cremove\u201D as in take off makeup. See enclosed dictionary evidence. \r\nIt appears that the word for takeoff in an airplane has no space, while take off (remove) has a space. Indeed, this provides consistency with Examiner\u2019s translation evidence, which translates to \u201Ctakeoff\u201D (as in an airplane) rather than \u201Ctake off\u201D with a space (like Registrant\u2019s marks), which means \u201Cremove.\u201D The connotations of the respective marks are therefore quite different.\r\n\r\nEven where the marks at issue are identical, or nearly identical, the Board has found that differences in connotation can outweigh visual and phonetic similarity. See Blue Man Prods. Inc. v.

I. du Pont, 476 F.2d at 1361-62, 177 USPQ at 567.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn this case, the following factors are the most relevant:  similarity of the marks, similarity of the goods and\/or services, and similarity of trade channels of the goods and\/or services.  See In re Opus One, Inc., 60 USPQ2d 1812 (TTAB 2001); In re Dakin\u2019s Miniatures Inc., 59 USPQ2d 1593 (TTAB 1999); In re Azteca Rest. Enters., Inc., 50 USPQ2d 1209 (TTAB 1999); TMEP \u00A7\u00A71207.01 et seq.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTaking into account the relevant du Pont factors, a likelihood of confusion determination in this case involves a two-part analysis.  The marks are compared for similarities in their appearance, sound, connotation and commercial impression.  TMEP \u00A7\u00A71207.01, 1207.01(b).  The goods and\/or services are compared to determine whether they are similar or commercially related or travel in the same trade channels.  See Herbko Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002); Han Beauty, Inc. v. Alberto-Culver Co., 236 F.3d 1333, 1336, 57 USPQ2d 1557, 1559 (Fed. Cir. 2001); TMEP \u00A7\u00A71207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nComparison of the Marks\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn a likelihood of confusion determination, the marks are compared for similarities in their appearance, sound, meaning or connotation and commercial impression.  In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973); TMEP \u00A71207.01(b).  Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find a likelihood of confusion.  In re White Swan Ltd., 8 USPQ2d 1534, 1535 (TTAB 1988); In re Lamson Oil Co., 6 USPQ2d 1041, 1043 (TTAB 1987); see TMEP \u00A71207.01(b).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe question is not whether people will confuse the marks, but whether the marks will confuse people into believing that the goods and\/or services they identify come from the same source.  In re West Point-Pepperell, Inc., 468 F.2d 200, 201, 175 USPQ 558, 558-59 (C.C.P.A. 1972); TMEP \u00A71207.01(b).  For that reason, the test of likelihood of confusion is not whether the marks can be distinguished when subjected to a side-by-side comparison.  The question is whether the marks create the same overall impression.  See Recot, Inc. v. M.C. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329-30, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1899 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Visual Info. Inst., Inc. v. Vicon Indus. Inc., 209 USPQ 179, 189 (TTAB 1980).  The focus is on the recollection of the average purchaser who normally retains a general rather than specific impression of trademarks.  Chemetron Corp. v. Morris Coupling & Clamp Co., 203 USPQ 537, 540-41 (TTAB 1979); Sealed Air Corp. v. Scott Paper Co., 190 USPQ 106, 108 (TTAB 1975); TMEP \u00A71207.01(b).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe applicant\u2019s mark, \u201CCORESCORE\u201D, is identical to the registrant\u2019s mark, \u201CCORESCORE\u201D, and will lead to consumer confusion. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nComparison of the Goods and Services\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhen determining whether there is a likelihood of confusion, all circumstances surrounding the sale of the goods and\/or services are considered.  Industrial Nucleonics Corp. v. Hinde, 475 F.2d 1197, 177 USPQ 386 (C.C.P.A. 1973).  These circumstances include the marketing channels, the identity of the prospective purchasers and the degree of similarity between the marks and between the goods and\/or services.  In comparing the marks, similarity in any one of the elements of sound, appearance or meaning is sufficient to find a likelihood of confusion.  In comparing the goods and\/or services, it is necessary to show that they are related in some manner.  In re Mack, 197 USPQ 755, 757 (TTAB 1977); TMEP \u00A7\u00A71207.01 et seq.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe goods and\/or services of the parties need not be identical or directly competitive to find a likelihood of confusion.  See Safety-Kleen Corp. v. Dresser Indus., Inc., 518 F.2d 1399, 1404, 186 USPQ 476, 480 (C.C.P.A. 1975); TMEP \u00A71207.01(a)(i).  Rather, it is sufficient that the goods and\/or services are related in some manner and\/or the conditions surrounding their marketing are such that they would be encountered by the same purchasers under circumstances that would give rise to the mistaken belief that the goods and\/or services come from a common source.  In re Total Quality Group, Inc., 51 USPQ2d 1474, 1476 (TTAB 1999); TMEP \u00A71207.01(a)(i); see, e.g., On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086-87, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475-76 (Fed. Cir. 2000); In re Martin\u2019s Famous Pastry Shoppe, Inc., 748 F.2d 1565, 1566-68, 223 USPQ 1289, 1290 (Fed. Cir. 1984).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf the marks of the respective parties are identical, the relationship between the goods or services of the respective parties need not be as close to support a finding of likelihood of confusion as might apply where differences exist between the marks.  Century 21 Real Estate Corp. v. Century Life of America, 970 F.2d 874, 877, 23 USPQ2d 1698, 1701 (Fed. Cir. 1992), cert. denied 506 U.S. 1034 (1992); In re Opus One Inc., 60 USPQ2d 1812, 1815 (TTAB 2001); Amcor, Inc. v. Amcor Industries, Inc., 210 USPQ 70 (TTAB 1981); TMEP \u00A71207.01(a).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe applicant\u2019s services are \u201CBusiness monitoring services, namely, tracking websites of others to provide details about user click traffic or visits to the website\u201D and \u201CComputer services, namely, monitoring, testing, analyzing, and reporting on the Internet traffic control and content control of the websites of others; Computer services, namely, monitoring the websites of others to improve scalability and performance of websites of others\u201D.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe registrant\u2019s services are \u201CProviding business information services in the field of modeling, scoring and analytics, credit and statistical forecasting and analysis; consumer credit monitoring services; database management services featuring databases in the field of demographic, credit and marketing data; financial analysis and consultation; financial and credit information services, namely, provision of consumer credit report and credit score information; credit score simulation services, namely, providing credit information and credit analysis services to lenders and issuers of credit that enables a better understanding of the credit applicant's credit status; financial and credit reporting information provided by electronic means; information services, namely, providing information featuring financial data and statistics for use by lenders and financial institutions, credit and financial information reporting services provided by computer and on-line means and business and consumer information services in the fields of consumer and commercial credit, and consulting in connection therewith; providing an interactive computer database in the field of commercial and consumer credit reporting\u201D.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe applicant\u2019s services are closely related to the registrant\u2019s services because both entail the provision of business information and marketing data.  Therefore, the services of applicant and registrant are likely to travel through the same channels of trade to the same classes of purchasers.  Accordingly, because confusion as to source is likely, registration is refused under Trademark Act Section 2(d) based on a likelihood of confusion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the goods and\/or services, but to protect the registrant from adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar mark by a newcomer.  See In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 1993).  Therefore, any doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination is resolved in favor of the registrant.  TMEP \u00A71207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1265, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1003 (Fed.

Cir. 1988).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFinally, the Examining Attorney is not bound by past decisions of the Trademark Examining Operation.  In re Shapely, Inc., 231 USPQ 72, 75 (TTAB 1986).  The Examining Attorney must resolve any doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion in favor of the prior registrant and against the applicant who has a legal duty to select a mark that is totally dissimilar to trademarks already being used.  Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Warner-Lambert Co., 203 USPQ 191 (TTAB 1979); In re Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc., 837 F.2d 463, 6 USPQ2d 1025 (Fed. Cir., 1988).  TMEP \u00A7\u00A71207.01(d)(i).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlthough the trademark examining attorney has refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal to register by submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf applicant chooses to respond to the refusal(s) to register, then applicant must also respond to the following requirement(s).","completion":"The Examining Attorney has maintained her citation to US Reg. No. 3,471,517 for the mark CORESCORE as a bar to registration.  While Applicant remains of the opinion that no likelihood of confusion exists between the subject mark and the mark of the cited Registration, in an effort to secure the Examining Attorney\u2019s approval for publication, it has deleted the services described as:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProviding business information services in the field of modeling, scoring and analytics, credit and statistical forecasting and analysis; database management services featuring databases in the field of demographic and marketing data.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplicant respectfully submits that the deletion of the foregoing services is sufficient to resolve the Examining Attorney\u2019s likelihood of confusion refusal.  As  the subject application\u2019s Class 35 recitation of services now only covers credit-related services and the cited Registration covers services used to track internet use, it cannot be asserted that confusion is likely to occur.  In view of the foregoing, it is respectfully submitted that the refusal of registration under Section 2(d) should be withdrawn and that the subject application be approved for publication.  Further and favorable action in connection with the application is earnestly solicited."}
{"prompt":"Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in\r\nU.S. Registration No. 6113447. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. \u00A71052(d); see TMEP\r\n\u00A7\u00A71207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.\r\nTrademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered\r\nmark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source\r\nof the goods and\/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. \u00A71052(d). Likelihood of confusion is\r\ndetermined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours\r\n& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the \u201Cdu Pont factors\u201D). In re\r\ni.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017).

The Applicant of the prior pending currently sells women\u2019s clothing and shoes.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of a likelihood of confusion analysis is for the benefit of the Registrants, to determine \u201Cwhether the marks are sufficiently similar in terms of their commercial impression\u201D such that persons who encounter the marks would be likely to assume a connection between the parties. Leading Jewelers Guild, 82 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1905.\r\n\r\nBut the question of confusion is related not to the nature of the mark but to its effect \"when applied to the goods of the applicant.\" The only relevant application is made in the marketplace. The words \"when applied\" do not refer to a mental exercise, but to all of the known circumstances surrounding use of the mark (In re E.I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361 (CCPA 1973)).\r\n\r\nIt is proper to consider the E.I. DuPont Factors (In re E.I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361 (CCPA 1973)):\r\nThe similarity or dissimilarity of the marks in their entireties as to appearance, sound, connotation and commercial impression.\r\nThe Registrant\u2019s mark is EASYMEDICARE. \u201CMedicare\u201D is a government-provided medical system in the US, it is not a proprietary mark of the Registrant. \u201CEasy\u201D describes a characteristic of the Registrant\u2019s insurance services, namely that it is easy and non-complex and possibly fast. Since the services are insurance services presumably the Medicare claims are easy to file compared with the governments own process. The mark is therefore descriptive of the Registrant\u2019s services. Descriptive marks have a smaller ambit of protection since they must be available to all participants in the market to describe their services.\r\nThe Application is REAL EASY MEDICARE, for medical services in class 044. It starts with a different word REAL, which has no analog and is not similar to anything in the Registrant\u2019s mark. Typically the first word in a mark is accorded greater importance than subsequent words in terms of consumer impression.\r\nEven where the marks at issue are identical, or nearly identical, the Board has found that differences in connotation can outweigh visual and phonetic similarity. See Blue Man Prods. Inc. v. Tarmann, 75 U.S.P.Q.2d 1811, 1820\u201321 (T.T.A.B.2005) (finding that BLUE MAN GROUP \u201Chas the connotation of the appearance of the performers\u201D and that applicant's BLUEMAN mark \u201Chas no such connotation for cigarettes or tobacco. Thus, the marks differ in their connotations and commercial impressions\u201D) (Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012). In the Coach case, even though the marks were identical the commercial impression was found to be very different, and no likelihood of confusion was found by the Court.\r\nThe similarity or dissimilarity of and nature of the goods or services as described in an application or registration or in connection with which a prior mark is in use.\r\nThe Registration is for insurance services, while the Application provides health care, namely \u201CHealth care in the nature of health maintenance organizations; Providing healthy lifestyle and nutrition services, namely, personal assessments, personalized routines, maintenance schedules, and counseling\u201D. \r\nInsurance is in a different field from the medical services, typically the insurance services are employer provided so are marketed and sold to an HR department, which is a sophisticated consumer. Consumers seek out insurance services not when they are sick, but when there is a change in circumstances; they are starting a new job or having a child, for example. Health care is sought when a person is feeling sick or requires medical care. \r\nAlso, the regulation is quite different - insurance companies are regulated by different bodies, under different terms from health care providers. In California, the Department of Managed Health Care DMHC manages HMOs and California Department of Insurance has regulatory authority over health insurance.\r\nThe fame of the prior mark (sales, advertising, length of use).\r\nThe Registration does not appear to be famous.\r\nThe nature and extent of any actual confusion.\r\nThere is no evidence of actual confusion.\r\nIt is submitted that the DuPont factors weigh in favor of the Applicant\u2019s mark, such that there is no likelihood of confusion with the cited Registration. \r\n"}

See 15 U.S.C. \u00A71052(d). Likelihood of confusion is determined on a case-\r\nby-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357,\r\n1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the \u201Cdu Pont factors\u201D). In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866\r\nF.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017).

See\r\nIn re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Therefore, any\r\ndoubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination is resolved in favor of the registrant. TMEP\r\n\u00A71207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v.

When comparing marks, \u201C[t]he proper test is not a side-by-side comparison of the marks, but\r\ninstead whether the marks are sufficiently similar in terms of their commercial impression such that\r\n[consumers] who encounter the marks would be likely to assume a connection between the parties.\u201D\r\nCai v.

Consequently,\r\nthe proper focus is on the recollection of the average purchaser, who retains a general rather than\r\nspecific impression of trademarks. In re Ox Paperboard, LLC, 2020 USPQ2d 10878, at *4 (TTAB\r\n2020) (citing In re Bay State Brewing Co., 117 USPQ2d 1958, 1960 (TTAB 2016)); In re Inn at St.\r\nJohn\u2019s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018); TMEP \u00A71207.01(b); see In re St. Helena Hosp.,\r\n774 F.3d 747, 750-51, 113 USPQ2d 1082, 1085 (Fed. Cir. 2014).\r\nIn this instance, the respective marks create the same general overall commercial impression because\r\nthe marks share the same sound, appearance, and connotation created by the shared legally identical\r\nfirst term FY. FY is the dominant portion of the applicant\u2019s proposed mark because it is the first\r\nportion of the proposed mark. Consumers are generally more inclined to focus on the first word, prefix,\r\nor syllable in any trademark or service mark. See Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin\r\nMaison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1372, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1692 (Fed.

Century Life of Am., 970 F.2d 874, 876, 23 USPQ2d 1698,\r\n1700 (Fed Cir. 1992) (finding similarity between CENTURY 21 and CENTURY LIFE OF AMERICA\r\nin part because \u201Cconsumers must first notice th[e] identical lead word\u201D); see also In re Detroit Athletic\r\nCo., 903 F.3d 1297, 1303, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1049 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding \u201Cthe identity of the\r\nmarks\u2019 two initial words is particularly significant because consumers typically notice those words\r\nfirst\u201D).\r\nThe applicant's standard character FY wording is legally identical to the stylized cited FY mark. A\r\nmark in typed or standard characters may be displayed in any lettering style; the rights reside in the\r\nwording or other literal element and not in any particular display or rendition. See In re Viterra Inc.,\r\n671 F.3d 1358, 1363, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1909 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 1342,\r\n1348, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010); 37 C.F.R. \u00A72.52(a); TMEP \u00A71207.01(c)(iii). Thus, a\r\nmark presented in typed or standard characters generally will not avoid likelihood of confusion with a\r\nmark in stylized characters and\/or with a design element because the standard character mark could be\r\npresented in the same manner of display as the stylized mark. See, e.g., In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at\r\n1363, 101 USPQ2d at 1909; Squirtco v. Tomy Corp., 697 F.2d 1038, 1041, 216 USPQ 937, 939 (Fed.\r\nCir. 1983) (stating that \u201Cthe argument concerning a difference in type style is not viable where one\r\nparty asserts rights in no particular display\u201D).\r\nThe addition of the term NATURALS does not obviate the refusal. Adding a term to a registered mark\r\ngenerally does not obviate the similarity between the compared marks, as in the present case, nor does\r\nit overcome a likelihood of confusion under Section 2(d). See Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. Jos. E.\r\nSeagram & Sons, Inc., 526 F.2d 556, 557, 188 USPQ 105, 106 (C.C.P.A. 1975) (holding BENGAL and\r\nBENGAL LANCER and design confusingly similar); In re Toshiba Med. Sys.

In the present case, the marks are legally identical in\r\npart.\r\nFurthermore, the likelihood of confusion is increased in this case because the goods are identical and\/or\r\nare closely related. Where the goods of an applicant and registrant are identical or virtually identical,\r\nthe degree of similarity between the marks required to support a finding of likelihood of confusion is\r\nnot as great as in the case of diverse goods. See In re Bay State Brewing Co., 117 USPQ2d 1958, 1960\r\n(TTAB 2016) (citing Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1368, 101 USPQ2d\r\n1713, 1721 (Fed.

Applicant\u2019s goods are quite different in terms of the products \u201CWrinkle removing skin care preparations\u201D and the channels of trade, since these are sold differently from eyelash preparations. Applicant requests suspension of the application to await the registration or abandonment of the Prior pending.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of a likelihood of confusion analysis is for the benefit of the Registrants, to determine \u201Cwhether the marks are sufficiently similar in terms of their commercial impression\u201D such that persons who encounter the marks would be likely to assume a connection between the parties. Leading Jewelers Guild, 82 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1905.\r\n\r\nBut the question of confusion is related not to the nature of the mark but to its effect \"when applied to the goods of the applicant.\" The only relevant application is made in the marketplace. The words \"when applied\" do not refer to a mental exercise, but to all of the known circumstances surrounding use of the mark (In re E.I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361 (CCPA 1973)).\r\n\r\nIt is proper to consider the E.I. DuPont Factors (In re E.I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361 (CCPA 1973)):\r\nThe similarity or dissimilarity of the marks in their entireties as to appearance, sound, connotation and commercial impression.\r\nRegistration is for FY design, where the f and y connect at the top.\r\n\r\nApplicant\u2019s mark is FYNATURALS, which differs from the Registration in that the mark is FY in capitals with NATURALS in one word, so people are likely to pronounce it together, as in \u201Cfie-naturals.\u201D In the case of registrant\u2019s mark, they may simply refer to the letters \u201Ceff-wye.\u201D\r\nNATURALS also does not appear in the dictionary, it is not a plural form of \u201Cnatural\u201D since \u201Cnatural is an adjective.\u201D NATURALS therefore provides some further distinctive elements over the Registration. \r\n\r\nFurther, in applicant\u2019s mark the FYNATURALS derives from Forever Young Naturals, so FY is an acronym formed from Forever Young. The connotation is therefore different.\r\n\r\nEven where the marks at issue are identical, or nearly identical, the Board has found that differences in connotation can outweigh visual and phonetic similarity. See Blue Man Prods. Inc. v. Tarmann, 75 U.S.P.Q.2d 1811, 1820\u201321 (T.T.A.B.2005) (finding that BLUE MAN GROUP \u201Chas the connotation of the appearance of the performers\u201D and that applicant's BLUEMAN mark \u201Chas no such connotation for cigarettes or tobacco.

In the Coach case, even though the marks were identical the commercial impression was found to be very different, and no likelihood of confusion was found by the Court.\r\nThe similarity or dissimilarity of and nature of the goods or services as described in an application or registration or in connection with which a prior mark is in use.\r\nApplicant has narrowed  the goods to \u201CWrinkle removing skin care preparations,\u201D to avoid a likelihood of confusion with the Registration; the wrinkle removing skin care preparations are non-cosmetic as they remove wrinkles. Registrant\u2019s goods are cosmetic in nature, so alter appearance with no actual effect on the skin.  \r\nThe fame of the prior mark (sales, advertising, length of use).\r\nThe Registration does not appear to be famous.\r\nThe nature and extent of any actual confusion.\r\nThere is no evidence of actual confusion. \r\nIt is submitted that the DuPont factors weigh in favor of the Applicant\u2019s mark, such that there is no likelihood of confusion with the cited Registration. \r\n"}

Although the\r\nmarks are spelled differently or appear differently does not obviate the likelihood of confusion because\r\nthe marks are phonetic equivalents, creating the same sound when pronounced, and this similarity alone\r\nis sufficient to support a finding that the marks are confusingly similar.\r\nA mark in typed or standard characters may be displayed in any lettering style; the rights reside in the\r\nwording or other literal element and not in any particular display or rendition. See In re Viterra Inc.,\r\n671 F.3d 1358, 1363, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1909 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 1342,\r\n1348, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010); 37 C.F.R. \u00A72.52(a); TMEP \u00A71207.01(c)(iii). Thus, a\r\nmark presented in stylized characters and\/or with a design element generally will not avoid likelihood\r\nof confusion with a mark in typed or standard characters because the word portion could be presented\r\nin the same manner of display. See, e.g., In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1363, 101 USPQ2d at 1909;\r\nSquirtco v. Tomy Corp., 697 F.2d 1038, 1041, 216 USPQ 937, 939 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (stating that \u201Cthe\r\nargument concerning a difference in type style is not viable where one party asserts rights in no\r\nparticular display\u201D).\r\nTherefore, the marks are confusingly similar.\r\nFLOW, in stylized font (U.S. Registration No. 6130110)\u2022\r\nIn this case, the marks are highly similar because the marks share the wording\/phrasing, FLOW. The\r\nonly difference between the marks is applicant's substitution of stylizations and the addition of the\r\nwording TECH in its mark.\r\nWhen evaluating a composite mark consisting of words and a design, the word portion is normally\r\naccorded greater weight because it is likely to make a greater impression upon purchasers, be\r\nremembered by them, and be used by them to refer to or request the goods and\/or services. In re\r\nViterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting CBS Inc. v.\r\nMorrow, 708 F.2d 1579, 1581-82, 218 USPQ 198, 200 (Fed.

Thus, although marks must be\r\ncompared in their entireties, the word portion is often considered the dominant feature and is accorded\r\ngreater weight in determining whether marks are confusingly similar, even where the word portion has\r\nbeen disclaimed. In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1366-67, 101 USPQ2d at 1911 (citing Giant Food, Inc.\r\nv. Nation\u2019s Foodservice, Inc., 710 F.2d 1565, 1570-71, 218 USPQ2d 390, 395 (Fed. Cir. 1983)).\r\nHere, even though applicant substitutes stylizations, the substitution of the stylizations do not alter the\r\noverall commercial impression between the marks because purchasers are more likely to be impressed\r\nby the wording of the mark. Thus, the more dominant feature is the wording, which is afforded greater\r\nweight in determining whether the marks are confusingly similar. Thus, the presentation of the applied-\r\nfor mark, in stylized font with the inclusion of the design, compared with the registrant\u2019s mark does not\r\ndiminish its similarity to the registered mark or obviate a likelihood of confusion finding.\r\nIncorporating the entirety of one mark within another does not obviate the similarity between the\r\ncompared marks, as in the present case, nor does it overcome a likelihood of confusion under Section\r\n2(d).

In the present case, the marks are identical in part.\r\nIn the present case, the applicant\u2019s addition of the wording, TECH, to the registrant\u2019s mark, FLOW,\r\ndoes not obviate the likelihood of confusion as the additional wording does not alter the overall\r\ncommercial impression between the marks. Thus, the marks are identical in part.\r\nMarks may be confusingly similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of\r\nterms or phrases appear in the compared marks and create a similar overall commercial impression.

This similarity creates a confusingly similar\r\ncommercial impression because consumers are likely to believe that registrant\u2019s mark is a condensed\r\nform of applicant\u2019s mark or that registrant has begun offering similar goods under another iteration of\r\nits registered mark. Thus, the addition of the wording TECH does not create a distinct commercial\r\nimpression that distinguishes applicant\u2019s mark from registrant\u2019s mark.\r\nTherefore, the marks are confusingly similar.\r\n2.

Leading Jewelers Guild, 82 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1905.\r\n\r\nBut the question of confusion is related not to the nature of the mark but to its effect\r\n\"when applied to the goods of the applicant.\" The only relevant application is made in\r\nthe marketplace. The words \"when applied\" do not refer to a mental exercise, but to all\r\nof the known circumstances surrounding use of the mark (In re E.I. DuPont DeNemours\r\n& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361 (CCPA 1973)).\r\n\r\nIt is proper to consider the E.I. DuPont Factors (In re E.I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., 476\r\nF.2d 1357, 1361 (CCPA 1973)):\r\n\r\n1. The similarity or dissimilarity of the marks in their entireties as to appearance,\r\nsound, connotation and commercial impression.\r\n\r\nThe registrant\u2019s TICK TOCK POP provides a connotation of a clock counting down and a\r\nOPO when the countdown has completed, wherein something pops. This is emphasized\r\nwith the logo wherein the POP is shown in a red comic-book explosion type font.\r\n\r\nThe application is for TOCK TICK PRESS, which is the name of a press, or printer. TOCK\r\nTICK also evokes a clock (with the sounds reversed) but not a timer running out with a pop at the end. Rather, Press refers to the sedentary business activity of reviewing and printing books for people to read. \r\n\r\nThe phrase 'tock tick', as distinct from, or when compared to 'tick tock' is referred to as an \"Ablaut Reduplication\" - in short there are linguistic rules as to the order of vowels and consonants in words that are repeated. The idea behind 'disobeying' those rules (i.e. choosing 'tock tick' as a name) is that it sounds or appears intuitively \"wrong\" in some sense, and marks it out as deliberately different from similar words which obey the Ablaut Reduplication formula. Accordingly, it is suggested that a trademark with the term 'tock tick' would not be confused with one including the 'correct' \"tick tock\", but rather acts as an almost automatic differentiating characteristic which would serve to highlight that whatever this 'tock tick press' is, it most certainly isn't a 'tick tock pop\". The connotation is different between the marks due to the sound, appearance and goods\/services but also the unique, memorable reversed form.\r\n\r\nEven where the marks at issue are identical, or nearly identical, the Board has found that\r\ndifferences in connotation can outweigh visual and phonetic similarity. See Blue Man\r\nProds. Inc. v. Tarmann, 75 U.S.P.Q.2d 1811, 1820\u201321 (T.T.A.B.2005) (finding that BLUE\r\nMAN GROUP \u201Chas the connotation of the appearance of the performers\u201D and that\r\napplicant's BLUEMAN mark \u201Chas no such connotation for cigarettes or tobacco.

Leading Jewelers Guild, 82 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1905.\r\n\r\nBut the question of confusion is related not to the nature of the mark but to its effect \"when applied to the goods of the applicant.\" The only relevant application is made in the marketplace. The words \"when applied\" do not refer to a mental exercise, but to all of the known circumstances surrounding use of the mark (In re E.I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361 (CCPA 1973)).\r\n\r\nIt is proper to consider the E.I. DuPont Factors (In re E.I.

The Registration is related to the roots of France and Franks (the tribe that is the precursor to the French people, well known in history, see attached). The mark is therefore descriptive of the geographic origin of the Registrant\u2019s products. The Registrant and presumably the products are French.\r\nFRANKIE in the application, on the other hand, refers to Frances, the first name of a the mother of the owner of the mark. Consumers coming into contact with the brand would understand this connection to a person associated with the mark. The marks are different and the connotation is different. \r\nEven where the marks at issue are identical, or nearly identical, the Board has found that differences in connotation can outweigh visual and phonetic similarity. See Blue Man Prods. Inc. v. Tarmann, 75 U.S.P.Q.2d 1811, 1820\u201321 (T.T.A.B.2005) (finding that BLUE MAN GROUP \u201Chas the connotation of the appearance of the performers\u201D and that applicant's BLUEMAN mark \u201Chas no such connotation for cigarettes or tobacco.

The words are almost identical, taking the\r\n\"U\" out of the registered mark and adding a power symbol in place of the \"O\" in applicant's mark.

The marks both imply \"keeping\" something \"on,\" in this case, referring to power,\r\nas they both are used in commerce in relation to items used for and with providing power and charging\r\nto devices.\r\nWhen evaluating a composite mark consisting of words and a design, the word portion is normally\r\naccorded greater weight because it is likely to make a greater impression upon purchasers, be\r\nremembered by them, and be used by them to refer to or request the goods and\/or services.

HUEMAN in the Registration refers to a person whose artist name is HUEMAN (see enclosed) and whose surname is Hueman. \r\nThe artist\u2019s full name is Allison Hueman (see enclosed). HUEMAN is primarily a surname, since it is the artist\u2019s surname and also the name of the applicant\/registrant in that case, HUEMAN LLC. Surnames are not registrable without evidence of long and exclusive use, and that the evidence of distinctiveness delays appropriation of exclusive rights in the name:\r\nThe Trademark Act, in \u00A72(e)(4), reflects the common law that exclusive rights in a surname per se cannot be established without evidence of long and exclusive use that changes its significance to the public from that of a surname to that of a mark for particular goods or services. The common law also recognizes that surnames are shared by more than one individual, each of whom may have an interest in using his surname in business; and, by the requirement for evidence of distinctiveness, the law, in effect, delays appropriation of exclusive rights in the name. In re Etablissements Darty et Fils, 759 F.2d 15, 17, 225 USPQ 652, 653 (Fed. Cir. 1985).\r\nDespite this prohibition, no claim for acquired distinctiveness was filed in the Registration. \r\nHUEMAN also refers to  the artists as a person, but no consent has been provided in the record.\r\nThe goods and services are closely connected to that artist and her art in the mind of consumers. Consumers would not think that the artist HUEMAN is now providing branding advice (the Applicant\u2019s services), for example. Consumers will expect the artist to provide artwork and exhibitions.\r\nEven where the marks at issue are identical, or nearly identical, the Board has found that differences in connotation can outweigh visual and phonetic similarity.

See\r\n15 U.S.C. \u00A71052(d). Likelihood of confusion is determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the\r\nfactors from In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567\r\n(C.C.P.A. 1973) (the \u201Cdu Pont factors\u201D). In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d\r\n1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of record related to those factors must be considered, but\r\n\u201Cnot all of the DuPont factors are relevant or of similar weight in every case.\u201D In re Guild Mortg. Co.,\r\n912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105\r\nF.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 (Fed. Cir. 1997)).\r\nAlthough not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any\r\nlikelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarity of the marks; and (2) the relatedness of the\r\nservices. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int\u2019l,\r\nInc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed.

App\u2019x 516, 2019 BL 343921\r\n(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP \u00A71207.01(b).\r\nMarks may be confusingly similar in appearance when they contain similar terms that create a similar\r\noverall commercial impression. See Crocker Nat\u2019l Bank v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228\r\nUSPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), aff\u2019d sub nom. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells\r\nFargo Bank, Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n, 811 F.2d 1490, 1495, 1 USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed.

These marks have highly similar appearances, sounds, and commercial impressions because\r\neach uses the identical phrase PREMIUM OUTLET(S) as its dominant term.\r\nSame Overall Structure. Substituting names of different geographic locations and adding the generic\r\nterm SHOP or SHOPPING does not reduce the potential for confusion. Despite these minor variations,\r\napplicant\u2019s mark and the registered marks are all still structured around the same phrase PREMIUM\r\nOUTLET(S), which conveys the same overall commercial impression of a high-quality shopping\r\ncenter. See Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 110 USPQ2d\r\n1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014). That common commercial impression may lead consumers to perceive\r\napplicant's NEW YORK PREMIUM OUTLET as either: (1) the exact same brand as the other\r\nPREMIUM OUTLET(S); or, if they notice the subtle variations between the marks, (2) some type of\r\nrelated sub-brand or spin-off establishment. Section 2(d) bars registration of confusingly similar marks\r\nto prevent this type of misunderstanding.\r\nWeakness or Dilution. Applicant argues that \"there are a lot of similar trademarks registered in many\r\ntrademark offices\" and cites search results from the European IP Office and Philippines Trademark\r\nOffice. First Response, at 5-6, 8-9. But the weakness or dilution of a mark is determined in the context\r\nof the number and nature of similar marks in use in United States interstate commerce\u2014the only type\r\nof commerce this Office has the authority to regulate. See TMEP \u00A7901.03 (detailing the scope of\r\nCongress's authority to regulate commerce). Any foreign registrations are beyond the purview of this\r\nOffice and do not affect the likelihood of confusion determination. See id.\r\nRegistrations Are Presumptively Valid. Applicant also argues that PREMIUM or PREMIUM\r\nOUTLET are \"generic\" terms, and that LOS ANGELES and NEW YORK are descriptive. First\r\nResponse, at 6-9; Second Response, at 2-4. But Trademark Act Section 7(b) provides that certificates of\r\nregistration on the Principal Register\u2014which registrant has here\u2014are prima facie evidence of the\r\nvalidity of a registered mark. 15 U.S.C. \u00A71057(b). The validity of a cited registration \u201Ccannot be\r\nchallenged in an ex parte proceeding.\u201D In re Fat Boys Water Sports LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1511, 1517\r\n(TTAB 2016). Accordingly, applicant\u2019s arguments about the distinctiveness of the cited marks (or the\r\nprior-pending applications which may become cited marks) will not be considered because to do so\r\nwould fail to give it the presumption of validity to which it are entitled. In re Fat Boys Water Sports\r\nLLC, 118 USPQ2d at 1517 (citing In re Fiesta Palms LLC, 85 USPQ2d 1360, 1363 (TTAB 2007)).\r\nGiven the highly similar appearances, sounds, and commercial impressions of NEW YORK\r\nPREMIUM OUTLET and the various registered forms of PREMIUM OUTLET(S) arising from the\r\nshared dominant phrase PREMIUM OUTLET, applicant\u2019s mark and the cited marks are confusingly\r\nsimilar.\r\nRelatedness of the Services\r\nThe compared services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. See\r\nOn-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir.\r\n2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP\r\n\u00A71207.01(a)(i). They need only be \u201Crelated in some manner\u201D or have \u201Cthe circumstances surrounding\r\ntheir marketing [be] such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the services] emanate\r\nfrom the same source.\u201D Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 101\r\nUSPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724\r\n(TTAB 2007)); TMEP \u00A71207.01(a)(i).\r\nThe previously attached evidence from Destiny USA, Tanger, and Westfield establishes that the same\r\nentity commonly offers, under the same trademark, both: (1) retail store services featuring clothing,\r\njewelry, bags, and other goods like applicant\u2019s; and (2) shopping mall management, leasing, and loyalty\r\nprograms like registrants\u2019. Given this overlap, these services are closely related for likelihood of\r\nconfusion purposes. See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB\r\n2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).\r\nLack of Identical Services. Applicant attempts to draw real-world distinctions between its business\r\nand those of the prior-pending applicants', framing the latter as \"large physical locations\" and the\r\nformer as \"only ... online retail services\" Response, at 4. But the likelihood of confusion determination\r\ndoes not turn on whether the applicant and registrant (or prior-pending applicant) provide identical\r\nservices. Since physical retail establishments likely also have a presence online, the potential for\r\nconfusion remains high. See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56\r\nUSPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894,\r\n1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP \u00A71207.01(a)(i).\r\nConsumer Sophistication & Standard of Care. Applicant also argues that some of the consumers\r\ninvolved here are \"sophisticated.\" Response, at 4. This does not reduce the potential for confusion for\r\nseveral reasons. First, there is no evidence in the record establishing this higher standard of care.\r\nSecond, even if there were, the fact that purchasers are sophisticated or knowledgeable in a particular\r\nfield does not necessarily mean that they are sophisticated or knowledgeable in the field of trademarks\r\nor immune from source confusion. TMEP \u00A71207.01(d)(vii); see, e.g., Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP\r\nv. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d. 1317, 1325, 110 USPQ2d 1157, 1163-64 (Fed. Cir. 2014); Top Tobacco\r\nLP v. N. Atl. Operating Co., 101 USPQ2d 1163, 1170 (TTAB 2011). Finally, where the purchasers\r\nconsist of both professionals and the public, as is presumably the case here absent any evidence to the\r\ncontrary, the standard of care for purchasing the services is that of the least sophisticated potential\r\npurchaser. In re FCA US LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1214, 1222 (TTAB 2018) (citing Stone Lion Capital\r\nPartners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d. at 1325, 110 USPQ2d at 1163), aff\u2019d per curiam, 777 F.\r\nApp\u2019x 516, 2019 BL 375518 (Fed. Cir. 2019).\r\nOther Factors & Principles\r\nLack of Actual Confusion Not Dispositive. Applicant notes that \"there is no evidence of actual\r\nconfusion.\" Response, at 4. But \"a showing of actual confusion is not necessary to establish a likelihood\r\nof confusion.\u201D In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017)\r\n(quoting Herbko Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1380\r\n(Fed. Cir. 2002)); TMEP \u00A71207.01(d)(ii). \u201C[T]he relevant test is likelihood of confusion,\r\nnot actual confusion.\u201D In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1309, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1053 (Fed.\r\nCir. 2018) (emphasis in original). \u201CUncorroborated statements of no known instances of actual\r\nconfusion ... are of little evidentiary value,\u201D especially in ex parte examination. In re Majestic Distilling\r\nCo., 315 F.3d 1311, 1317, 65 USPQ2d 1201, 1205 (Fed. Cir. 2003).\r\nFame. Applicant argues that \"the Prior pending applications do not appear to be famous.\" Response, at\r\n4. Even if there were evidence in the record supporting this (which there is not), lack of fame is not\r\nsignificant to the issue of likelihood of confusion in ex parte examination. See In re Davey Prods. Pty\r\nLtd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1204 (TTAB 2009) (citing In re Thomas, 79 USPQ2d 1021, 1027 n.11 (TTAB\r\n2006)); TMEP \u00A71207.01(d)(ix). Because the types of evidence bearing on the fame of a registered mark\r\ninclude the volume of sales, advertising expenditures, and length of use of the mark, and such evidence\r\nnormally is not publicly available, examiners are not expected to submit evidence regarding the fame of\r\na cited registered mark in ex parte proceedings. TMEP \u00A71207.01(d)(ix); see In re Mr. Recipe, LLC, 118\r\nUSPQ2d 1084, 1086 (TTAB 2016) (citing In re Thomas, 79 USPQ2d at 1027 n.11). When no evidence\r\nof fame has been provided, this du Pont factor is usually treated as neutral. See In re Mr. Recipe, LLC,\r\n118 USPQ2d at 1086. Thus, as here, this factor is considered neutral for purposes of determining\r\nlikelihood of confusion.\r\nEvidentiary Objection: Third-Party Registrations. Applicant's first response referenced various\r\nother registrations but does actually introduce those registrations into the record. In re Peace Love\r\nWorld Live, LLC, 127 USPQ2d 1400, 1405 n.17 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 1st USA Realty Prof\u2019ls, 84\r\nUSPQ2d 1581, 1583 (TTAB 2007); In re Duofold Inc., 184 USPQ 638, 640 (TTAB 1974)); TBMP\r\n\u00A71208.02; TMEP \u00A7710.03. To make a registration part of the record, an applicant must submit a copy\r\nof the registration\u2014or the complete electronic equivalent from the USPTO\u2019s systems\u2014prior to any\r\nappeal. In re Star Belly Stitcher, Inc., 107 USPQ2d 2059, 2064 (TTAB 2013); TBMP \u00A71208.02; TMEP\r\n\u00A7710.03. Merely referencing search results is not sufficient, and these registrations need not be\r\nconsidered. But even if they were, that would not change the outcome, as they are irrelevant to this\r\nlikelihood of confusion determination as detailed above.\r\nEvidentiary Objection: Screenshots & Links. Applicant\u2019s responses also include inline screenshots,\r\nlinks, and webpages without access dates. E.g., First Response, at 5-6, 9-10; Second Response, at 14-\r\n15. But applicant has not properly introduced any underlying websites into the record, so the Office\r\nobjects to any use of this evidence. Providing only a screenshot or link is not sufficient to introduce the\r\nunderlying website into the record. See In re ADCO Indus. \u2013 Techs., L.P., 2020 USPQ2d 53786, at *2\r\n(TTAB 2020) (citing In re Olin, 124 USPQ2d 1327, 1331 n.15 (TTAB 2017); In re HSB Solomon\r\nAssocs., LLC, 102 USPQ2d 1269, 1274 (TTAB 2012); TBMP \u00A71208.03); TMEP \u00A7710.01(b). To\r\nproperly introduce websites into the record, an applicant must provide: (1) a saved copy of each\r\nwebsite; (2) the date it accessed the website; and (3) the complete URL of the website. See In re ICoat\r\nCo., LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1730, 1733 (TTAB 2018); TBMP \u00A71208.03; TMEP \u00A7710.01(b). Since\r\napplicant's screenshots and links do not properly introduce any websites into the record, any underlying\r\nwebsites associated with those screenshots and links need not be considered. Even if they were,\r\nhowever, that would impact the analysis above or change the outcome.\r\nAny Doubt Resolved in Favor of Registrants. The overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer\r\nconfusion as to the source of the services, but to protect registrants from adverse commercial impact\r\ndue to use of a similar mark by a newcomer. See In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d\r\n1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Therefore, any doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination is\r\nresolved in favor of the registrants. TMEP \u00A71207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press,\r\nInc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1265, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2002); In re Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc.,\r\n837 F.2d 463, 464-65, 6 USPQ2d 1025, 1026 (Fed. Cir. 1988).\r\nConclusion\r\nApplicant\u2019s mark and the registered marks have highly similar appearances, sounds, and commercial\r\nimpressions, and they cover closely related services. Accordingly, there is a likelihood of consumer\r\nconfusion between these marks, so Section 2(d) bars registration of applicant\u2019s mark.\r\nAlthough applicant\u2019s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by\r\nsubmitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.\r\nADVISORY: PRIOR-FILED APPLICATIONS\r\nThe filing dates of pending U.S. Application Serial Nos. 87982158 and 87951181 precede applicant\u2019s\r\nfiling date. See previously attached applications. If either of those marks registers, applicant\u2019s mark\r\nmay be refused registration under Section 2(d) because of a likelihood of confusion between the two\r\nmarks. See 15 U.S.C. \u00A71052(d); 37 C.F.R. \u00A72.83; TMEP \u00A7\u00A71208. Accordingly, after receiving\r\napplicant's response, the Office may suspend action on this application until both marks in the earlier-\r\nfiled applications register or abandon.\r\nIn response to this letter, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by addressing the\r\nissue of the potential conflict between applicant\u2019s mark and the marks in these applications. Applicant\u2019s\r\nelection not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant\u2019s right to address this issue later\r\nif a refusal under Section 2(d) issues","completion":"\r\nU.S. APPLICATION SERIAL NO. 97329268\r\n\r\n\r\nMARK: NEW YORK PREMIUM OUTLET\r\n\r\n\r\nAmended Goods and services\r\nClass 035\r\nOn-line retail store services featuring a wide variety of consumer goods of others; On-line retail store services featuring bags, wallets, clothing, jewelry, shoes, t-shirts, jackets, hoodies, sportswear; the foregoing excluding gift cards\r\n\r\nSection 2(d) Likelihood of Confusion Refusal \r\n\r\nThe Examiner has cited Prior pending U.S. Application Serial Nos. 87982158 (LOS ANGELES PREMIUM OUTLETS with a disclaimer for \"LOS ANGELES\" AND \"OUTLETS\"), 87951181 (LOS ANGELES PREMIUM OUTLETS with a disclaimer for \"LOS ANGELES\" AND \"OUTLETS\")  as having a likelihood of confusion with the application under 2d.\r\n\r\nPrior pending Application 87982158  is for \u201CBusiness management services in connection with retail shopping centers; promoting the goods and services of others by means of operating retail shopping centers, namely, operating shopping facilities providing access to the retail stores of others; advertising and marketing services; digital marketing services; promoting the goods and services of others by means of on-line and in-person marketing of gift cards redeemable for the purchase of the goods and services of others; promoting the goods and services of others by means of sponsorship relationships and strategic alliances; on-line retail store services in the field of gift cards \u201C in class 035, \u201CReal estate management and leasing of retail shopping center space; retail shopping center services, namely, rental of shopping center space\u201D in class 036 and  \u201CReal estate development of retail shopping centers, namely, the planning and management of the construction of retail shopping venues \u201C in class 037.\r\n\r\nPrior pending Application 87951181 is for \u201CMagnetically encoded gift cards; magnetically encoded stored value cards \u201C in class 009 and \u201CRetail shopping center services, namely, the hosting and conducting of entertainment events at retail shopping venues, namely, fashion shows, musical performances, live video game tournaments, live appearances by costumed characters for children, and live holiday dance and music performances \u201C in class 041.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of a likelihood of confusion analysis is for the benefit of the Registrants, to determine \u201Cwhether the marks are sufficiently similar in terms of their commercial impression\u201D such that persons who encounter the marks would be likely to assume a connection between the parties. Leading Jewelers Guild, 82 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1905.\r\n\r\nBut the question of confusion is related not to the nature of the mark but to its effect \"when applied to the goods of the applicant.\" The only relevant application is made in the marketplace. The words \"when applied\" do not refer to a mental exercise, but to all of the known circumstances surrounding use of the mark (In re E.I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361 (CCPA 1973)).\r\n\r\nIt is proper to consider the E.I. DuPont Factors (In re E.I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361 (CCPA 1973)):\r\nThe similarity or dissimilarity of the marks in their entireties as to appearance, sound, connotation and commercial impression.\r\nThe cited applications are for LOS ANGELES PREMIUM OUTLETS, with \"LOS ANGELES\" AND \"OUTLETS\" disclaimed. There is a distinctiveness limitation as to \u201C\"PREMIUM OUTLETS\" wherein \u201COUTLETS\u201D, which clearly describes sales locations, is disclaimed.\r\n\r\n\u201CPREMIUM\u201D is generic for quality of the products, and hence cannot benefit from a claim of acquired distinctiveness. \r\n\r\nFrom TMEP \u00A71209.01:\r\nMarks that are merely descriptive of the goods or services may not be registered on the Principal Register absent a showing of acquired distinctiveness under 15 U.S.C. \u00A71052(f). See TMEP \u00A71209.01(b) regarding merely descriptive marks, and TMEP \u00A7\u00A71212\u20131212.10 regarding acquired distinctiveness.

These are targeted towards the owners of the shopping centers, sophisticated professionals, who need these services, rather than consumers (like Applicant\u2019s online retail services). Applicant has excluded gift cards from the goods sold in order to reduce the likelihood of confusion.\r\n\r\nIn terms of 87951181, Prior pending is for shopping center services which are large physical locations for retail. Applicant only provides online retail  services, which would be used by a consumer at home or on a mobile device, rather than a physical location like a shopping center. The services do not overlap and are directed mainly at different groups of consumers. \r\nThe fame of the prior mark (sales, advertising, length of use).\r\nThe Prior pending applications do not appear to be famous.\r\nThe nature and extent of any actual confusion.\r\nThere is no evidence of actual confusion. \r\nIt is submitted that the DuPont factors weigh in favor of the Applicant\u2019s mark, such that there is no likelihood of confusion with the cited Prior pending marks. \r\n\r\n\r\nObjection based on Primarily Geographically Descriptive 2(e)(2)\r\n\r\nExaminer objects to the Application as Primarily Geographically Descriptive under 2(e)(2).  Under 12010.01(a) of TMEP:\r\nTo establish a prima facie case for refusal to register a mark as primarily geographically descriptive, the examining attorney must show that:\r\n(1) the primary significance of the mark is a generally known geographic location (see TMEP \u00A7\u00A71210.02\u20131210.02(b)(iv));\r\n(2) the goods or services originate in the place identified in the mark (see TMEP \u00A71210.03); and\r\n(3) purchasers would be likely to believe that the goods or services originate in the geographic place identified in the mark (see TMEP \u00A7\u00A71210.04\u20131210.04(d)). Note: If the mark is remote or obscure, the public is unlikely to make a goods\/place or services\/place association (see TMEP \u00A71210.04(c)).\r\nWith respect to part 1 of the test, under TMEP 1210.02(a) \u201Cvague geographic terms (e.g. , \"Global,\" \"National,\" \"International,\" or \"World\") are not considered to be primarily geographic, though they may be merely descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive under \u00A72(e)(1). See TMEP \u00A71209.03(o).\u201D\r\nThe presence of PREMIUM OUTLETS in the name avoids the identification of the mark as primarily geographically descriptive.

In re\r\nViterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting CBS Inc. v.\r\nMorrow, 708 F.2d 1579, 1581-82, 218 USPQ 198, 200 (Fed.

Thus, although marks must be\r\ncompared in their entireties, the word portion is often considered the dominant feature and is accorded\r\ngreater weight in determining whether marks are confusingly similar, even where the word portion has\r\nbeen disclaimed.

Thus, the more dominant feature is the wording, which is\r\nafforded greater weight in determining whether the marks are confusingly similar. Thus, the\r\npresentation of the applied-for mark, in stylized font with the inclusion of the design, does not diminish\r\nits similarity to the registered mark or obviate a likelihood of confusion finding.\r\nTherefore, the marks are confusingly similar.\r\n2.

KENDO is a martial art that involves fighting with swords (see attached Wikipedia article). KENDOO has no meaning, and is certainly no synonymous with KENDO as it appears and looks different. The consumer impression of KENDO with its deep connection to Japanese samurai culture has a different connotation from the fanciful term KENDOO which has no meaning.

Applicant has merely removed the descriptive and\/or generic matter WOMAN from the\r\nwording in the mark in Registration No. 2899648. Although applicant\u2019s mark does not contain the\r\nentirety of the registered mark, applicant\u2019s mark is likely to appear to prospective purchasers as a\r\nshortened form of registrant\u2019s mark. See In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 1342, 1348, 94 USPQ2d\r\n1257, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting United States Shoe Corp., 229 USPQ 707, 709 (TTAB 1985)).\r\nThus, merely omitting some of the wording from a registered mark may not overcome a likelihood of\r\nconfusion. See In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 1342, 94 USPQ2d 1257; In re Optica Int\u2019l, 196 USPQ\r\n775, 778 (TTAB 1977); TMEP \u00A71207.01(b)(ii)-(iii). In this case, applicant\u2019s mark does not create a\r\ndistinct commercial impression from the registered mark because it contains some of the wording in the\r\nregistered mark and does not add any wording that would distinguish it from that mark. Furthermore,\r\nthe stylization of the mark in Registration No. 1498703 does not obviate the similarity between the\r\nmarks. The applied-for mark is in standard character form and may be displayed in any manner\r\nincluding identical to the registered mark. A mark in typed or standard characters may be displayed in\r\nany lettering style; the rights reside in the wording or other literal element and not in any particular\r\ndisplay or rendition. See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1363, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1909 (Fed. Cir.\r\n2012); In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 1342, 1348, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010); 37 C.F.R.\r\n\u00A72.52(a); TMEP \u00A71207.01(c)(iii). Thus, a mark presented in stylized characters and\/or with a design\r\nelement generally will not avoid likelihood of confusion with a mark in typed or standard characters\r\nbecause the word portion could be presented in the same manner of display. See, e.g., In re Viterra Inc.,\r\n671 F.3d at 1363, 101 USPQ2d at 1909; Squirtco v. Tomy Corp., 697 F.2d 1038, 1041, 216 USPQ 937,\r\n939 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (stating that \u201Cthe argument concerning a difference in type style is not viable\r\nwhere one party asserts rights in no particular display\u201D).\r\nBased on the foregoing, the applicant\u2019s applied-for and registrant\u2019s marks are sufficiently similar to\r\nfind a likelihood of confusion.\r\nComparison of the Goods\r\nThe compared goods need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion.

In this case, the wording in U.S. Registration No(s).\r\n5825658 is the more important feature of the mark. The mark(s) would not be further distinguished by\r\nthe additional design components since a consumer would reference the marks by the written word\r\nportion.\r\nThe mark in U.S. Registration No. 5825658 is \"JINDA HOME FASHION. The wording \u201CHOME\r\nFASHION\u201D has been disclaimed for descriptiveness of the registered goods and\/or services. Although\r\nmarks are compared in their entireties, one feature of a mark may be more significant or dominant in\r\ncreating a commercial impression. See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905,\r\n1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Nat\u2019l Data Corp., 753 F.2d 1056, 1058, 224 USPQ 749, 751 (Fed.

Disclaimed matter that is descriptive of or generic for a party\u2019s\r\ngoods and\/or services is typically less significant or less dominant when comparing marks. See In re\r\nDetroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie\r\nRests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 (Fed.

Pharmavite LLC, 2022 USPQ2d 557, at *41 (TTAB 2022); TMEP \u00A71207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii).\r\nTherefore, the wording \"HOME FASHION\" is less significant in terms of affecting the mark\u2019s overall\r\ncommercial impression and renders the wording \u201CJINDA\u201D the more dominant element of the mark.\r\nThe dominant wording \"JINDA\" in the applied-for mark and registrant\u2019s mark creates a similar overall\r\ncommercial impression. Marks may be confusingly similar in appearance where similar terms or\r\nphrases or similar parts of terms or phrases appear in the compared marks and create a similar overall\r\ncommercial impression.

Therefore, viewed as a whole, applicant\u2019s mark is substantially similar in sound,\r\nappearance, connotation, and commercial impression to the registrant's marks.\r\nBecause the marks look and sound similar and create the same commercial impression, the marks are\r\nconsidered similar for likelihood of confusion purposes.\r\nRelatedness of the Goods and\/or Services\r\nThe goods and\/or services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related,\r\nor travel in the same trade channels.

Thus, applicant\u2019s and\r\nregistrant\u2019s goods and\/or services are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes. See, e.g.,\r\nIn re Davey Prods.

Leading Jewelers Guild, 82 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1905.\r\n\r\nBut the question of confusion is related not to the nature of the mark but to its effect \"when applied to the goods of the applicant.\" The only relevant application is made in the marketplace. The words \"when applied\" do not refer to a mental exercise, but to all of the known circumstances surrounding use of the mark (In re E.I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361 (CCPA 1973)).\r\n\r\nIt is proper to consider the E.I. DuPont Factors (In re E.I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361 (CCPA 1973)):\r\nThe similarity or dissimilarity of the marks in their entireties as to appearance, sound, connotation and commercial impression.\r\n\"Jinda\" is the pronunciation of the Chinese word \"\u91D1\u8FBE\", which is the name of a gas station of the applicant's father. The applicant would like to use the same name as his father's business. JINDA is also a first name.\r\n\r\nThe consumer impression should be viewed in consideration of the mark as a whole, including the goods and disclaimed wording, which is still part of the mark.  Registration contains the wording HOME FASHION which indicates to consumers that the mark has to do with home fashion, like bedspreads and linens. Home fashion does not describe clothing like the Applicant\u2019s goods. The consumer impression and connotation are therefore different between the marks. \r\n\r\nEven where the marks at issue are identical, or nearly identical, the Board has found that differences in connotation can outweigh visual and phonetic similarity. See Blue Man Prods. Inc. v. Tarmann, 75 U.S.P.Q.2d 1811, 1820\u201321 (T.T.A.B.2005) (finding that BLUE MAN GROUP \u201Chas the connotation of the appearance of the performers\u201D and that applicant's BLUEMAN mark \u201Chas no such connotation for cigarettes or tobacco.

The goods as well as the channels of trade are therefore different. Please see enclosed evidence from Crate and Barrel, where linens are sold but no clothing. Consumers would not expect a home fashion store to also sell clothing.\r\nThe fame of the prior mark (sales, advertising, length of use).\r\nThe Registration does not appear to be famous.\r\nThe nature and extent of any actual confusion.\r\nThere is no evidence of actual confusion. \r\nIt is submitted that the DuPont factors weigh in favor of the Applicant\u2019s mark, such that there is no likelihood of confusion with the cited Registration. \r\n"}

In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1050\r\n(Fed. Cir. 2018) (\u201C[Regarding the issue of confusion,] there is nothing improper in stating that . . . more\r\nor less weight has been given to a particular feature of a mark, provided the ultimate conclusion rests\r\non consideration of the marks in their entireties.\u201D (quoting In re Nat\u2019l Data Corp., 753 F.2d 1056, 1058,\r\n224 USPQ 749, 751 (Fed. Cir. 1985)).\r\nAlthough marks are compared in their entireties, one feature of a mark may be more significant or\r\ndominant in creating a commercial impression. See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 128\r\nUSPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., 105 F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d\r\n1531, 1533-34 (Fed.

See In re Detroit Athletic\r\nCo., 903 F.3d at 1305, 128 USPQ2d at 1050 (citing In re Dixie Rests., 105 F.3d at 1407, 41 USPQ2d at\r\n1533-34). The dominant portion of each mark is the term PORTTEUS, which appears with identical\r\nspelling in each mark. For Registrant's mark, this term is the primary component of the standard\r\ncharacter mark. Similarly, the term PORTTEUS is the longest and most distinctive term in the mark.\r\nThe additional matter in the appliaction is the term LE, which consumers may see as analagous to\r\nadding the word \"the\" to the front of the term PORTTEUS.\r\nAdding a term to a registered mark generally does not obviate the similarity between the compared\r\nmarks, as in the present case, nor does it overcome a likelihood of confusion under Section 2(d). See\r\nCoca-Cola Bottling Co. v. Jos. E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 526 F.2d 556, 557, 188 USPQ 105, 106\r\n(C.C.P.A. 1975) (holding BENGAL and BENGAL LANCER and design confusingly similar); In re\r\nToshiba Med. Sys.

In the present case,\r\nthe marks are identical in part. Each mark shares the identical and dominant term PORTTEUS.\r\nWhen comparing similar marks, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board has found that inclusion of the\r\nterm \u201Cthe\u201D at the beginning of one of the marks will generally not affect or otherwise diminish the\r\noverall similarity between the marks. See In re Thor Tech Inc., 90 USPQ2d 1634, 1635 (TTAB 2009)\r\n(finding WAVE and THE WAVE \u201Cvirtually identical\u201D marks; \u201C[t]he addition of the word \u2018The\u2019 at the\r\nbeginning of the registered mark does not have any trademark significance.\u201D); In re Narwood Prods.\r\nInc., 223 USPQ 1034, 1034 (TTAB 1984) (finding THE MUSIC MAKERS and MUSIC-MAKERS\r\n\u201Cvirtually identical\u201D marks; the inclusion of the definite article \u201Cthe\u201D is \u201Cinsignificant in determining\r\nlikelihood of confusion\u201D). Here, Applicant's mark features the inclusion of the term LE at the beginning\r\nof their mark. The attached article from Rocket Languages explains that LE means \"the\" in French.\r\nFunctionally, the addition of this term is analagous to adding the word \"the\" to the front of a registered\r\nmark. This addition does little to change the overall commercial impression of these marks.\r\nOverall, these marks appear to identify a common PORTTEUS source.\r\nBecause the marks look and sound similar and create the same commercial impression, the marks are\r\nconsidered similar for likelihood of confusion purposes.\r\nRelatedness of the Goods and\/or Services\r\nThe goods and\/or services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related,\r\nor travel in the same trade channels.

Wine decanters are made for use with wines. The attached evidence shows that entities\r\nthat sell wines also sell decanters for those wines. Thus, applicant\u2019s and registrant\u2019s goods and\/or\r\nservices are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes. See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty\r\nLtd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys.

Leading Jewelers Guild, 82 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1905.\r\n\r\nBut the question of confusion is related not to the nature of the mark but to its effect \"when applied to the goods of the applicant.\" The only relevant application is made in the marketplace. The words \"when applied\" do not refer to a mental exercise, but to all of the known circumstances surrounding use of the mark (In re E.I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361 (CCPA 1973)).\r\n\r\nIt is proper to consider the E.I. DuPont Factors (In re E.I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361 (CCPA 1973)):\r\nThe similarity or dissimilarity of the marks in their entireties as to appearance, sound, connotation and commercial impression.\r\nPORTTEUS is a surname (see attached evidence). The Registration\u2019s name PORTTEUS likely refers to the wine-making family. Applicant\u2019s mark is LE PORTTEUS, which is clearly not a surname.\r\nWhile the registration is PORTTEUS for wines, the applicant\u2019s mark is LE PORTTEUS, LE being the masculine definite article in French. Therefore a customer would identify the Applicant\u2019s mark as French. It would translate to \u201Cthe Portteus.\u201D The connotation is therefore somewhat different from the Registrant\u2019s surname mark.\r\nEven where the marks at issue are identical, or nearly identical, the Board has found that differences in connotation can outweigh visual and phonetic similarity. See Blue Man Prods. Inc. v. Tarmann, 75 U.S.P.Q.2d 1811, 1820\u201321 (T.T.A.B.2005) (finding that BLUE MAN GROUP \u201Chas the connotation of the appearance of the performers\u201D and that applicant's BLUEMAN mark \u201Chas no such connotation for cigarettes or tobacco.

In the Coach case, even though the marks were identical the commercial impression was found to be very different, and no likelihood of confusion was found by the Court.\r\nThe similarity or dissimilarity of and nature of the goods or services as described in an application or registration or in connection with which a prior mark is in use.\r\nApplicant\u2019s goods are for decanters - even though they are for wine it is unusual for a wine company, that makes a consumable product, to also make household kitchen goods like decanters. It may be that there are some decanters with a winer\u2019s name thereon but that is ornamental usage, for advertising the winery. The winery does not actually make the decanter.\r\n\r\nThe fame of the prior mark (sales, advertising, length of use).\r\nThe Registration does not appear to be famous.\r\nThe nature and extent of any actual confusion.\r\nThere is no evidence of actual confusion. \r\nIt is submitted that the DuPont factors weigh in favor of the Applicant\u2019s mark, such that there is no likelihood of confusion with the cited Registration. \r\n"}

Leading Jewelers Guild, 82 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1905.\r\n\r\nBut the question of confusion is related not to the nature of the mark but to its effect \"when applied to the goods of the applicant.\" The only relevant application is made in the marketplace. The words \"when applied\" do not refer to a mental exercise, but to all of the known circumstances surrounding use of the mark (In re E.I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361 (CCPA 1973)).\r\n\r\nIt is proper to consider the E.I. DuPont Factors (In re E.I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361 (CCPA 1973)):\r\nThe similarity or dissimilarity of the marks in their entireties as to appearance, sound, connotation and commercial impression.\r\nRegistration THREE FISH BRAND is closely tied to the logo of three swimming fish. On the specimen of use the wording THREE FISH BRAND is very small and de-emphasized in comparison with the fish drawing (please see attached specimen from the registration). More dominant than THREE FISH BRAND is the wording SEATTLE\u2019S MUTUAL FISH COMPANY and SEAFOOD SEASONING. On the red, more recent specimen, the THREE FISH BRAND is practically unreadable under the lower fish image.\r\n \r\nIn the Registrant\u2019s mark the wording FISH and BRAND are generic and descriptive for the product, respectively. Only the THREE carries any distinctiveness, and this is different from the application, where 3FISH appears without a space, as a single word. The 3FISH wording is emphasized and the logo elements are de-emphasized. The logo elements are unique and different from the Registration. It should be emphasized that in the wording 3FISH, 3 and F are joined together and that 3 is presented as an Arabic numeral in a typeface that resembles a smiley or love emoji.  In social media and text messaging, the Arabic numeral 3 indicates smile or love.   It originates from the practice of using the numeral \"3\" to symbolize a heart shape, as the rounded curves of the number resemble the shape of a heart.  The presence of the numeral 3 versus spelled-out words creates a clear visual dissimilarity between the two marks.\r\n\r\nEven where the marks at issue are identical, or nearly identical, the Board has found that differences in connotation can outweigh visual and phonetic similarity. See Blue Man Prods. Inc. v. Tarmann, 75 U.S.P.Q.2d 1811, 1820\u201321 (T.T.A.B.2005) (finding that BLUE MAN GROUP \u201Chas the connotation of the appearance of the performers\u201D and that applicant's BLUEMAN mark \u201Chas no such connotation for cigarettes or tobacco.

In the Coach case, even though the marks were identical the commercial impression was found to be very different, and no likelihood of confusion was found by the Court.\r\nThe similarity or dissimilarity of and nature of the goods or services as described in an application or registration or in connection with which a prior mark is in use.\r\nThe applicant\u2019s mark is for \u201CCanned fish; Canned sardines; Canned tuna; Frozen fish; Frozen shellfish; Fish, canned; Frozen seafood\u201C in class 029 and \u201CDistributorship services in the field of fish and seafood\u201D in class 035.

However, although applicant\u2019s\r\nmark does not contain the entirety of the registered mark, applicant\u2019s mark is likely to appear to\r\nprospective purchasers as a shortened form of registrant\u2019s mark.

Thus, merely omitting some of the wording from a registered mark may not\r\novercome a likelihood of confusion.

In this case, applicant\u2019s\r\nmark does not create a distinct commercial impression from the registered mark because it contains\r\nsome of the wording in the registered mark and does not add any wording that would distinguish it\r\nfrom that mark.\r\nAdditionally, a mark in typed or standard characters, like the applied-for mark, may be displayed in any\r\nlettering style, including registrants'; the rights reside in the wording or other literal element and not in\r\nany particular display or rendition. See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1363, 101 USPQ2d 1905,\r\n1909 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 1342, 1348, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1260 (Fed.

Thus, a mark presented in stylized characters and\/or\r\nwith a design element generally will not avoid likelihood of confusion with a mark in typed or standard\r\ncharacters because the word portion could be presented in the same manner of display. See, e.g., In re\r\nViterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1363, 101 USPQ2d at 1909; Squirtco v. Tomy Corp., 697 F.2d 1038, 1041,\r\n216 USPQ 937, 939 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (stating that \u201Cthe argument concerning a difference in type style is\r\nnot viable where one party asserts rights in no particular display\u201D).\r\nFor these reasons, the marks are confusingly similar for purposes of likelihood of confusion.\r\nApplicant\u2019s and Registrant\u2019s Goods and Services are Related\r\nWhen analyzing an applicant\u2019s and registrant\u2019s goods and\/or services for similarity and relatedness, that\r\ndetermination is based on the description of the goods and\/or services in the application and registration\r\nat issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use. See Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital\r\nLLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1323, 110 USPQ2d 1157, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Octocom Sys. Inc. v.\r\nHous.

Thus, applicant\u2019s and registrant\u2019s goods and\/or services are related.\r\nBecause applicant\u2019s and registrant\u2019s marks are confusingly similar and the associated goods and\r\nservices are related, there is a likelihood of confusion, and the applied-for mark is therefore refused.\r\nAlthough applicant\u2019s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by\r\nsubmitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.","completion":"U.S. APPLICATION SERIAL NO. 79333826\r\n\r\n\r\nMARK: ONE LIFE \r\n\r\n\r\nAmended Goods and services\r\nClass 035\r\nRetail store services featuring clothing and clothing\r\naccessories; retail store services featuring clothing; wholesale store services featuring clothing\r\n\r\nSection 2(d) Likelihood of Confusion Refusal \r\n\r\nThe Examiner has cited U.S. Registration Nos. 4046979 (\u201CONE L L ONE LIFE LEGACY\u201D) owned by 1 Life Legacy, 3645401 (\u201CONE LIFE FAMILY\u201D) owned by One Life One Family LLC, and 5531566 (\u201CONELIFE\u201D) owned by Furythreads Clothing Co. as having a likelihood of confusion with the application under 2d.\r\n\r\nIt appears that 3645401 (\u201CONE LIFE FAMILY\u201D) has not been renewed and is therefore canceled.\r\n\r\nThe first registered mark \"1 L L 1 LIFE LEGACY\" (stylized with design) is for \u201CRetail store services featuring clothing and accessories\u201D in Class 35. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe second registered mark \"ONE LIFE FAMILY\" (stylized with design) includes \u201CRetail clothing boutiques; Retail clothing stores; Retail clothing stores; Second hand dealerships featuring clothing\u201D in Class 35.\r\n\r\n\r\n The third registered mark \"ONELIFE\" (in standard characters) is for \u201CHats; shirts; socks\u201D in Class 25. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of a likelihood of confusion analysis is for the benefit of the Registrants, to determine \u201Cwhether the marks are sufficiently similar in terms of their commercial impression\u201D such that persons who encounter the marks would be likely to assume a connection between the parties.

It is a \u201Clife legacy\u201D that the Registration is referring to, rather than one life.

Leading Jewelers Guild, 82 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1905.\r\n\r\nBut the question of confusion is related not to the nature of the mark but to its effect \"when applied to the goods of the applicant.\" The only relevant application is made in the marketplace. The words \"when applied\" do not refer to a mental exercise, but to all of the known circumstances surrounding use of the mark (In re E.I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361 (CCPA 1973)).\r\n\r\nIt is proper to consider the E.I. DuPont Factors (In re E.I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361 (CCPA 1973)):\r\nThe similarity or dissimilarity of the marks in their entireties as to appearance, sound, connotation and commercial impression.\r\nThe Prior pending is for CFM, which stands for Certified Facility Manager as can be seen from the specimen.  IFMA, the owner of the CFA mark, is the provider of the certification, which consumers presumably need to carry on their occupation as a certified facility manager. This involves knowledge of real estate, understanding buildings and maintenance and personnel management, as well as risk assessment (see enclosed). Those consumers looking for this certification will understand CFM to stand for Certified Facility Manager. They would not focus on other meanings for CFM like cubic feet per minute or control flow model, both common expressions that shorten to CFM.\r\n\r\nApplicant\u2019s mark is CCFM which stands for certified corporate financial manager. Consumers of this program would know all about the CCFM certified corporate financial manager program since they presumably require it to work in the field. They would also clearly understand the differences in Prior pending CFM and the Applicant\u2019s mark CCFM since CFM is a facilities management certification, and CCFM is a corporate financial management certification. They are completely different fields. \r\n\r\nClearly, employment certifications are very important to the wellbeing and financial health of consumers. Since they are so important, any decision regarding which training program to follow would be a well thought out decision, not subject to confusion. Imagine a facilities manager completes the wrong course, namely one for corporate financial management, in order to fulfill a job requirement. It simply wouldn\u2019t happen. The connotations are different, the purpose of the training is completely different and the consumer is very careful in her decision making.  \r\nEven where the marks at issue are identical, or nearly identical, the Board has found that differences in connotation can outweigh visual and phonetic similarity. See Blue Man Prods. Inc. v. Tarmann, 75 U.S.P.Q.2d 1811, 1820\u201321 (T.T.A.B.2005) (finding that BLUE MAN GROUP \u201Chas the connotation of the appearance of the performers\u201D and that applicant's BLUEMAN mark \u201Chas no such connotation for cigarettes or tobacco. Thus, the marks differ in their connotations and commercial impressions\u201D) (Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012). In the Coach case, even though the marks were identical the commercial impression was found to be very different, and no likelihood of confusion was found by the Court.\r\nThe similarity or dissimilarity of and nature of the goods or services as described in an application or registration or in connection with which a prior mark is in use.\r\nThe Prior pending is for facilities management, namely ensuring a physical facility is operating smoothly for the tenants to be able to carry on their business,  while the application is for corporate financial management, an area similar to accounting, making decisions and optimizing the use of financial resources. \r\n\r\nThe nature of the services and the ultimate purpose are highly dissimilar, and the consumer is sophisticated in respect of purchasing decisions since the certification is required to carry on an employment.\r\n\r\nThe number and nature of similar marks in use on similar goods.\r\n\r\nThere are a large number of  meanings to CFM, which depend very much on the industry.  \r\n\r\n\r\nRecent Federal Court decisions such as JUICE GENERATION, INC. v. GS ENTERPRISES LLC (Appeal from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, Trademark Trial and Appeal Board in No. 91206450) and Jack Wolfskin Ausr\u00FCstung Fur Draussen GmbH & Co. KGAA v.
